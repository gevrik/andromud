<h2>General Tips</h2>
	
<p>AndroMud's command bar supports simple command AND complex commands.</p>

<p>For simple command, just type any command for your MUD game/TELNET session. </p>

<p>For complex command, you can combine multiple simple commands and send as a complex command. Each command is separated by ; (semicolumn)</p>

<p>For example, typing and sending "n;n;n" is the same as send commmand "n" three times.<p>
