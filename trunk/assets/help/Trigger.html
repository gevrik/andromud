<h2>Trigger</h2>
<p>AndroMud supports triggers for command automation.</p>

<p>A trigger is formed by 2 parts, a pattern and a trigger body. When text displayed on screen matches any pattern specified in trigger, the corresponding trigger body is executed as normal command. Trigger body can contain any alias/simple/complex commands.</p>

<p>Triggers can be added/modified/deleted from trigger setup dialog. In mud session, tap menu key and select "Trigger Setup" will bring you to the setup dialog. Make sure to disable trigger feature before setting up any triggers. This is to avoid any misfire on incomplete triggers.</p>
