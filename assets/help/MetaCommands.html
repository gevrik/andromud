<h2>Meta Commands</h2>

<p>AndroMud also support a few meta commands.<p>

<p>1. Repeat command: #number followed by a simple/complex command.</p>
<p>For example: you can send "#3 n" and this is the same as typing "n" three times.

<p>2. Wait command: #wa number, this will let the following commands wait a few milliseconds before sending. The exact time is specified in "num" part of this command.</p>
<p>For example: "n;#wa 2000;n" means send command "n" and wait for 2 seconds before sending the next "n"</p>
