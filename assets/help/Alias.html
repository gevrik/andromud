<h2>Alias</h2>
<p>You can create aliases to simplify your commands in MUD.<p>

<p>For example, you can replace a command sequence with a few characters. When you type your own defined alias characters, AndroMud will send out command sequences for you</p>

<p>An alias file is associated with each MUD/TELNET session. You can define aliases for each mud. Each time the mud session is loaded, alias file is automatically loaded.<p>

<p>To add/modify/delete mud aliases, simply tap on the menu button when you are in a mud session. And choose "Alias" option from the menubar. A alias editor will show and allow you to edit any existing alias or create new ones.</p>
<p>Each alias must have a title and body. Alias body is the same as any regular commands.</p>

<p>For example, a valid alias can be like this: title: <strong>test, body: #3 n;#wa 3000;#3 s</strong></p>

<p>Another valid alias can be titled: test2, body:<strong>#3 test</strong></p>

<p>Note that alias can use other aliases in its body.</p>
